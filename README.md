- Yes a long name but does what it says.
- It creates a virtual environment 'venv', fetches all dependancies, and runs a simple gui to check if it works.
- That's basically it.

# Prerequisites
* Bash is installed in the system.
* A debian based system ( This will change in future )

# How to use
- Fetch the latest release from the releases page

```
> *Make sure you execute the above in a dedicated folder.*
